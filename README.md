This repository is part of the 2021 IROS-RSJ Robotic Challenge for Young Students! IROS-RSJ The Challenge will use Webots for robot simulation (https://cyberbotics.com). It is easy to install on any computer, and many different programming languages can be used (templates for C++, Python and MATLAB will be provided). The robot used will be PAL Robotics TiaGo++ (https://pal-robotics.com/robots/tiago/).

Each team may be composed by 1 to 6 students (as defined), and 1 to 2 advisors (typically a professor). The Selection stage is oriented at robot navigation tasks, where focus is on autonomously moving the robot base. In the standard in-door environment, the random navigation task will be generated for each team. The automatic scoring will be based on: i) maximize success of the task, ii) minimize relative time of navigation, and iii) minimize length of generated code.

Final stage will involve robot vision and manipulation tasks. Each participating team is provided the tutorials and rules with the competition benchmarks.

Approach: -> we first applied object avoidance like method to avoid the obstacles -> as we already know the waypoints co-ordinates we first tried to make a predefined map -> as the environment was a maze like structure , due to comlexity of the program we switched to way finding method -> In this method we just move our as per the availabe space excluding the obstacles -> we made th rpogram to collect as many waypoints as possible -> if bot is stuck we gave the move backward operation and then the repeating the finding route operation.

Result: The bot collected the majority of waypoints of the total with avoiding the obstacles giving us the worlwide 4th position (worldwide).
